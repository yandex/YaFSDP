## Overview

YaFSDP is a Sharded Data Parallelism framework, designed to work well with transformer-like
neural network architectures.

You can find more info on YaFSDP internals in our blog post on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex/articles/817509/).

## Advantages over FSDP

YaFSDP is up to 20% faster for pre-training LLMs and performs better in high
memory pressure conditions. It is designed to reduce communications and memory operations overhead.

### Benchmarks

We've compared YaFSDP with FSDP on a variety of pre-training setups ranging from:

- 7B to 70B parameters
- 64 to 256 devices
- 2048 to 8192 tokens per sequence

Details:

- In each run, per-device batch size is set to 1.
- We report the relative difference in iteration time when switching from FSDP to YaFSDP as `speedup`.
- `num-ckpt-layers` refers to the number of transformer layers for partial activation recomputation.
- Evaluations were done at A100 80G cluster.

## Examples

To try out YaFSDP you should:

1. Build the docker image with `docker/build.sh`.
2. Launch one of the examples in the `examples` folder.

The docker image is based on [NVIDIA image for PyTorch](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) with [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), and [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl). Patches for the libraries are provided in [patches/](./patches/) and are needed for YaFSDP to work with huggingface.

In the examples, we provide two common configurations for Llama-3 8B: `clm.md` for causal pre-training and `sft.md` for supervised fine-tuning.
